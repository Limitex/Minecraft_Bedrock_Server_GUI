The server software console is displayed on the left. 

You can enter commands in the text box below it. Send with Enter.

The server information is displayed on the right side.

At the bottom right, you can easily check the entry status of the player, which was difficult to grasp.

In the center, the transition of the player and the memory usage status are displayed up to 5 minutes ago.
